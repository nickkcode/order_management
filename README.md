# Order Management Application  
## A Next.js Application for Managing Orders at Our Food Stall During the College Fest  

### The Problem  
Managing orders and ensuring everyone receives the correct items is a challenging task, especially in a crowded situation. Initially, we considered using a manual receipt book to write down each order and give customers a handwritten receipt. However, we quickly realized that this would take too much time and decrease our efficiency.

### Solution 0  
We thought of purchasing a small thermal printer to print a receipt for each order. At this point, we had already built a basic Next.js app to track our orders and store them in a database. We considered making it local, and we initially thought of using IndexedDB (though as a beginner, I wasn't sure if this was the best approach). Nevertheless, we had a working app that allowed us to take orders and record our sales in the database. The plan was to integrate a thermal printer with the system to print receipts for every order.  

The problem with this approach, however, was that it was going over budget without offering enough value. As a result, we decided to abandon that idea.
